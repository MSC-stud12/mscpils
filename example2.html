  <h3>JavaScript types</h3>
  <p>JavaScript has two methods to get the type of a variable: typeof() works on simple types, Object.prototype.toString.call() works
    on Objects, such as lists.</p>
  <p><div id="table"></div></p>

  <!-- dynamically create a table with type information -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
  html = "<table>";
  html += "<tr><td><b>JavaScript</b></td><td><b>typeof(variable)</b></td><td><b>Object.prototype.toString.call(variable)</b></td></tr>";
  // the next 
  var variables = [
    "var variable = true;",
    "var variable = 1;",
    "var variable = 1.0;",
    "var variable = 'a string';",
    "var variable = { 'key':'value' };",
    "var variable = [ 'a', 'list' ];",
    "var variable = function() {};"
  ]
  for (var i=0; i<variables.length; i++) {
    html += "<tr>";
    html += "<td>" + variables[i] + "</td>";
    eval(variables[i]); // create the variable
    html += "<td>" + typeof(variable) + "</td>";
    html += "<td>" + Object.prototype.toString.call(variable) + "</td>";
    html += "</tr>";
  }
  html += "</table>";
  document.getElementById("table").innerHTML = html;
  </script>
